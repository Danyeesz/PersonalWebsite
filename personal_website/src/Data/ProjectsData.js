    description: `Team size: 4 \nGenre: Ludic Game
    \nThis game was one of the first I worked on with a team. The team size was 4 people including me. I was the only programmer, while there were 2 designers and 1 artist. Here we worked with specific themes, we had to build our game around. Ours was Mahatma Gandhi. This project was pretty challenging for me due to the fact I was the only programmer and this was the first time I worked on a game with a team.`,

    title: 'Hotel Tome',
    description: `Team size: 5 \nGenre: Point-and-click Adventure
    \nThis game was developed in a team of 5. 2 designers, 2 programmers, 1 artist. This project was developed during the second semester of university. This game was a big challange for me, because we used Unreal Engine 4 for development, which I have never used before. For the final presentation we ended up with a pretty unique game. I learned a lot about Unreal Engine during this time.`,

    title:'Wobble Gang',
    description: `Team size: 4 \nGenre: Multiplayer
    \nIt was the project of my 3rd semester where we had to create a multiplayer game. I worked with 3 of my classmates. On this project I worked with one other programmer on the programming side. Everything went really smooth, because we had the same ideas and we could help each other out when we were stuck at something. It was pretty challenging to create a multiplayer game, since none of us worked with this genre before.`,
