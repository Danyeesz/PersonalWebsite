I am Dániel István a 21 year old, Hungarian, student. I have been intrested in Computer Science since I started using computers. 
After my elementary school studies I went to a secondary school which was specialised in Computer Science.
Following my secondary school studies I applied to Cologne Game Lab, where I study game development and programming. I am currently in my 4th semester. At the end of every semester we have to develop a small game in a team of 4-6, so I have some experience with teamwork.

In my free time, I like to ride a bike, play football, play board and video games. I also like to learn about new technologies both on hardware and software side. In the last few months I have been mostly interested in web development. I speak English, Hungarian and a little bit of German aswell. 
Currently I am looking for an internship that I can do in my 5th semester of university.
If you are interested in my CV `;
